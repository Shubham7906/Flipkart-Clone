      <h3>Home and Furniture</h3>
      <p class="p1">
        Moving to a new place is never easy, especially if you're buying new
        furniture. Beds, sofa sets, dining tables, wardrobes, and TV units -
        it's not easy to set up everything again. With the hundreds of options
        thrown at you, the ride could be overwhelming. What place is reliable,
        what furniture will stand the test of time? These are questions you must
        ask before you choose a store. Well, our Durability Certified Furniture
        Store has not only curated a range of furniture keeping in mind the
        modern Indian consumer but furniture that comes with a lab
        certification, ensuring they last you for up to 10 years. Yes, all our
        furniture has gone through 35 stability and load tests so that you
        receive only the best-quality furniture. Be FurniSure, always. Names to
        look out for are Nilkamal, Godrej Interio, Urban Ladder, HomeTown,
        Durian and Perfect Homes. You may have your furniture all set up, but
        they could end up looking flat and incomplete without complementary
        decor. Curtains, cushion covers, bed sheets, wall shelves, paintings,
        floor lamps - find everything that turns a house to an inviting home
        under one roof at Flipkart.
